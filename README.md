# Side Effects Handlers in Compose

Hey there Android devs üëã, This article helps in managing side effects in Jetpack Compose which is essential for building robust and efficient Android applications explained with a list of available side effects handlers and examples.

Hey just a minute üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è star this GitHub repo for future reference: [TharunBalaji2004/compose-side-effects-handlers](https://github.com/TharunBalaji2004/compose-side-effects-handlers)

## What is meant by side effects?

From the official documentation of Android, A **side-effect** is a change to the state of the app that happens outside the scope of a composable function. In simpler terms, any function, statement, or action that should not be done by any other composable is known as a side effect.

Lets understand it with a simpler example!

```kotlin
var counter = 1

@Composable
fun DisplayText() {
    counter++;
    Text(text = "Hello there!")
}
```

From the above code as we can see that, the Composable `DisplayText()` should display only the text "Hello there!", but the increment statement of `counter` variable is present inside the code, which is out of scope for the respective composable. Some examples of side effects are:

* Performance side effects - Memory Usage, UI Performance
    
* State Management side effects
    
* Lifecycle side effects
    
* Coroutines side effects
    

## What is side effect Handlers?

In Jetpack Compose, side effect handlers are a way to manage and handle side effects, such as asynchronous operations or interactions with the external world (e.g., network requests, database queries, or sensor data), in a declarative and controlled manner.

The list of side effect handlers are:

* SideEffect
    
* LaunchedEffect
    
* DisposableEffect
    
* rememberUpdatedState
    
* rememberCorutineScope
    
* produceState
    
* derviedStateOf
    

## SideEffect

SideEffect is a side-effect API in Jetpack Compose that allows you to perform asynchronous operations and update the UI in a single lambda function. It takes single argument, `block` to define the statements that has to be executed.

The SideEffect is executed on every recomposition of the parent composable, which means that the operations are executed and updated reactively. It is important to use it carefully, as it can lead to performance problems if it is used incorrectly.

Consider the following code:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun ListOfNames() {
    val nameList = remember { mutableStateOf(listOf<String>()) }
    nameList.value = fetchData()  // Newtowrk Call

    LazyColumn {
        items(nameList.value) { item ->
            Card(modifier = Modifier
                .fillMaxWidth(1f)
                .padding(bottom = 5.dp)) {
                Text(text = item, modifier = Modifier.padding(10.dp))
            }
        }
    }
}
```

There exist two problems with the above code snippet:

* The network call `fetchData()` could be called multiple times by user, which causes server overload by receiving high volume of requests at a time
    
* The network call `fetchData()` might take more time to respond or send data from the server to application
    

To solve these problems, the SideEffect executes asynchronous operations such as API calls, coroutine execution, etc whenever the recomposition of parent composable occurs.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun ListOfNames() {
    val nameList = remember { mutableStateOf(listOf<String>()) }
    
    // Gets executed when Recomposition occurs
    SideEffect {
        nameList.value = fetchData()
    }

    LazyColumn {
        items(nameList.value) { item ->
            Card(modifier = Modifier
                .fillMaxWidth(1f)
                .padding(bottom = 5.dp)) {
                Text(text = item, modifier = Modifier.padding(10.dp))
            }
        }
    }
}
```

But SideEffect is not the feasible method for performing async network calls, since it executes multiple times as recomposition occurs. For these operations, the LaunchedEffect comes into the picture.

## LaunchedEffect

LaunchedEffect is a side-effect API in Jetpack Compose that allows you to perform asynchronous operations and update the UI in a single lambda function. It takes two arguments, `key` for representing when should it be executed and `block` to declare the lambda function.

The suspend function is executed in `CoroutineScope` when the LaunchedEffect enters the composition for the first time, and it is also executed whenever the value of any of the parameters changes.

The LaunchedEffect helps to control asynchronous operations such as API calls, coroutine execution, etc whenever the `key` changes. If the `key` is not defined, then it gets executed only when the initial composition occurs and updates the UI.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun ListOfNames() {
    val nameList = remember { mutableStateOf(listOf<String>()) }
    
    // Gets executed when initial Composition occurs
    LaunchedEffect(key1 = Unit, block = {
        nameList.value = fetchData()
    })

    LazyColumn {
        items(nameList.value) { item ->
            Card(modifier = Modifier
                .fillMaxWidth(1f)
                .padding(bottom = 5.dp)) {
                Text(text = item, modifier = Modifier.padding(10.dp))
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## DisposableEffect
DisposableEffect is a side-effect API in Jetpack Compose, used for managing resources that need to be acquired and released when a Composable is created and destroyed. It's especially useful for managing resources that have a lifecycle associated with a Composable and need to be cleaned up when the Composable is no longer active.

1. **First Composition**: The code inside the `DisposableEffect` block is executed when the Composable is first composed. This is typically when the Composable is initially displayed or when its parent Composable is initially composed.
    
2. **Removal from Composition**: The code inside the `onDispose` block is executed when the Composable is removed from the composition. This occurs when the Composable is no longer needed or when its key changes.

Consider the following code snippet:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun ListOfNames() {
    val nameList = remember { mutableStateOf(listOf<String>()) }
    
    // Gets executed when initial Composition occurs
    DisposableEffect(key1 = Unit, effect = {
        nameList.value = fetchData()
        onDispose {    // Gets executed when composition gets destroyed
            nameList.value = emptyList()
        }
    })


    LazyColumn {
        items(nameList.value) { item ->
            Card(modifier = Modifier
                .fillMaxWidth(1f)
                .padding(bottom = 5.dp)) {
                Text(text = item, modifier = Modifier.padding(10.dp))
            }
        }
    }
}
```

By using DisposableEffect, we can ensure that resources are properly managed and cleaned up when they are no longer needed, which is crucial for the overall stability and performance of your Composable-based UI.
